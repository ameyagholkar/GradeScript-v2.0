GradeScript v2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
Made with Python.
----------------------------------------------------------------
This version of GradeScript aims to incorporate the compilation &
execution of Student's Test files as well - along with all the previous
functionality. 

Current Works aim at specifying a efficient protocol for handling of
Scanner inputs so as to make the script either accept text re-direction
or completely overlook them.
Also, in the works is a standard execution command for the script like
our own Linux commands.

Current Usage:
$ ./grade.py [(optional)Project Name] [(optional - only if it exists)Gradesheet filename]
